We will deploy Opal and Armadillo behind an Nginx reverse proxy, start locally with self‑signed TLS, and then show how to go live with Let’s Encrypt. Expect practical Linux/SSH usage from a terminal and a copy‑pasteable flow you can follow on your laptop.\n\n\nWorkshop Details\nThis workshop will be delivered at the DataSHIELD 2025 Conference in Lausanne (23-26 September 2025) on Tuesday, September 23rd from 13:30 to 16:30 at room POL-338 (TBC).\n\n\nGetting started\n\nReview your setup: Environment Setup\nSkim the essentials: Get up to speed\n\n\n\nWorkshop scope\n\nDeploy Opal and Armadillo with Docker Compose (no Kubernetes)\nNginx reverse proxy: local self‑signed → Let’s Encrypt\nBasic Linux/SSH workflows suitable for on‑prem and cloud\nOptional: lightweight monitoring with Telegraf + Grafana (time permitting)\n\n\n\nWho this is for\n\nBeginners to sysadmin tasks; we explain each step\nAttendees on macOS (Apple Silicon ok), Windows (Docker Desktop/WSL2), or Linux\nFollow‑along is encouraged but not mandatory\n\n\n\nPrerequisites (summary)\nSee details in Environment Setup.

    "text": "Why start with local deployment?\n\nLocal keeps friction low: no DNS, firewalls, or cloud costs. You can validate the stack in minutes on any laptop.\nSafe sandbox: use HTTP and avoid exposing services to the internet while you explore features.\nDeveloper‑friendly: iterate on DataSHIELD code and packages against a predictable, reproducible environment.\nPortable: the same Compose foundation scales up later (add DNS, TLS, and hardening without changing core services).\nTeaching aid: a contained lab to learn Opal and Rock.\n\n\n\nArchitecture at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n  B[\"Browser&lt;br/&gt;http://localhost:8080\"] --&gt;|8080| O[\"Opal (8080)\"]\n  subgraph Profiles[\"docker network: opalnet\"]\n    O --&gt;|R/DataSHIELD| R[\"Rock (8085)\"]\n    O --&gt;|Auxiliary| MONGO[\"MongoDB (27017)\"]\n  end\n\n  %% Define a lighter background for the subgraph\n  classDef light fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#aaa,stroke-width:1px;\n  class Profiles light;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices and roles\n\nOpal (OBiBa):\n\nMain DataSHIELD server and admin UI. Exposes HTTP on 8080.\nReads configuration via environment variables (e.g., OPAL_ADMINISTRATOR_PASSWORD, MONGO_*, ROCK_HOSTS) docs docs.\n\nRock (R server):\n\nExecutes R/DataSHIELD calls initiated by Opal, reachable as rock:8085 on the Docker network.\nShips with DataSHIELD packages; ideal for quick connectivity checks.\n\nMongoDB (auxiliary store):\n\nUsed by Opal for auxiliary features; we pin to mongo:6.0 per Opal guidance.\n\n\n\n\nGoal\nDeploy Opal locally on your laptop using Docker Compose. This lets you try DataSHIELD quickly without DNS or cloud setup and is perfect for package development and smoke tests. See the prerequisites in @env_setup.qmd and the scope in @up_2_speed.qmd.\n\n\nWhat we will deploy\n\nOpal server (obiba/opal:latest) with admin password set\nRock R server (datashield/rock-base:latest) for DataSHIELD execution\nMongoDB for auxiliary storage\n\nReferences: - Opal Docker image + env vars: Installation — Docker Image and Configuration - Templates adapted from: easy-opal compose template (docker-compose.yml.tpl); see also helper commands (src/commands)\n\n\nFiles layout\nUse this folder layout:\nopal-local/\n├── .env\n├── docker-compose.yml\n\n\n1) Create a .env file\nKeep secrets out of the compose file.\nOPAL_ADMINISTRATOR_PASSWORD=ChangeMe123!\n\nOPAL_ADMINISTRATOR_PASSWORD is required on first start of obiba/opal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProduction note: For production deployments, the most correct way to handle sensitive information is through Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets, or your platform’s native secrets management system. We use a .env file here for workshop simplicity, which also helps reduce the risk of password leaks when sharing docker-compose files for reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n2) docker-compose.yml\nDefines Opal, Rock, and MongoDB. Key env vars match Opal docs (MONGO_*, ROCK_HOSTS) opaldoc installation.\nservices:\n  opal:\n    image: obiba/opal:latest\n    depends_on:\n      - rock\n      - mongo\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n      - \"8443:8443\"\n    environment:\n      - OPAL_ADMINISTRATOR_PASSWORD=${OPAL_ADMINISTRATOR_PASSWORD}\n      - MONGO_HOST=mongo\n      - MONGO_PORT=27017\n      - ROCK_HOSTS=rock:8085\n    volumes:\n      - opal_srv:/srv\n  mongo:\n    image: mongo:6.0\n    volumes:\n      - mongo_data:/data/db\n\n  rock:\n    image: datashield/rock-base:latest\n    environment:\n    - ROCK_ID=new-stack-rock\n\nvolumes:\n  opal_srv:\n  mongo_data:\n\nnetworks:\n  opalnet:\nHighlights: - Opal sees Rock at rock:8085 and MongoDB via service names on the internal network. - Opal is directly accessible on port 8080 for simplicity. - All services run on the opalnet Docker network.\n\n\n3) Bring it up\nFrom the directory containing docker-compose.yml and .env:\ndocker compose up -d\n# First start may take a minute while images are pulled.\n\n# Check health\ndocker compose ps\ndocker compose logs -f opal | cat\n\nOpen http://localhost:8080 in your browser.\nLogin with user administrator and the password you set in .env.\n\nIf you see the Opal UI and can navigate the Admin area, your stack is running.\n\n\n4) Minimal DataSHIELD test (R)\nVerify connectivity via DSOpal/DSI.\nlibrary(DSI)\nlibrary(DSOpal)\nlibrary(httr)\nset_config(config(ssl_verifyhost = 0L, ssl_verifypeer = 0L))\nlibrary(dsBaseClient)\n\n\nb &lt;- DSI::newDSLoginBuilder()\nb$append(\n    server   = \"local\",\n    url      = \"http://localhost:8080\",\n    user     = \"administrator\",\n    password = \"ChangeMe123!\",\n    profile = \"default\"\n)\n\nlogins &lt;- b$build()\nconns &lt;- DSI::datashield.login(logins)\nds.ls()\nNotes: - The Opal + Rock images are DataSHIELD‑ready by design. If a package appears missing, ensure Rock pulled the latest image or install required packages in Rock. - For real deployments, use HTTPS with proper certificates and omit the SSL verification overrides.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nOpal not reachable: check if port 8080 is available locally.\nLogin fails: ensure OPAL_ADMINISTRATOR_PASSWORD was set at first start; to reset, stop containers, remove opal_srv volume, and start again.\nMongo version: Opal expects MongoDB ≤ 6.0; using mongo:6.0 matches docs.\nRock connection issues: check that Rock container is running and healthy.\n\n\n\nNext steps\nWhen ready to go live, add Nginx reverse proxy with TLS, DNS configuration, and hardening as we’ll cover in the later section. For now, you have a working local Opal + DataSHIELD lab.",
