# Introduction 

This site hosts materials for a hands‑on workshop on deploying and managing Opal and Armadillo. We will cover local deploy of the infrastructure, manage of profiles and profile creation. As extra material we will have a look at strategies of monitoring of the infrastructure. Expect practical Linux/SSH usage from a terminal and a copy‑pasteable flow you can follow on your laptop. The materials of this workshop, especially the live deploy part are applicable to cloud deployments as well.

# Workshop Details

This workshop will be delivered at the **DataSHIELD 2025 Conference** in Lausanne (23-26 September 2025) on **Tuesday, September 23rd from 13:30 to 16:30** at room **POL-338** (TBC).

# Workshop scope

- Deploy Opal and Armadillo with Docker Compose (no Kubernetes)
- Nginx reverse proxy: go live with Let's Encrypt
- Basic Linux/SSH workflows suitable for on‑prem and cloud
- Optional: lightweight monitoring with Telegraf/Prometheus + Grafana (time permitting)

# Who this is for
